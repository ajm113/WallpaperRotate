## F.A.Q

*feh is an X11 image viewer aimed mostly at console users. Unlike most other viewers, it does not have a fancy GUI, but simply displays images. It is controlled via commandline arguments and configurable key/mouse actions.* -- feh Website

You may need to change the filename to something else. Name it `wallpaperrotate` or something easy to remember or tab to like `wrr`.
