## F.A.Q

### What is feh?

*feh is an X11 image viewer aimed mostly at console users. Unlike most other viewers, it does not have a fancy GUI, but simply displays images. It is controlled via commandline arguments and configurable key/mouse actions.* -- feh Website

### I can't copy to /usr/bin/wr! File already exists!

You may need to change the filename to something else. Name it `wallpaperrotate` or something easy to remember or tab to like `wrr`.
